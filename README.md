# Diabetic-retinopathy-detection

In this project, I trained a deep neural network model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual Blocks to detect the type of Diabetic Retinopathy from images. Diabetic Retinopathy is a disease that results from complication of type 1 and 2 diabetes. The disease can develop if blood sugar levels are left uncontrolled for a prolonged period of time. It is caused by the damage of blood vessels in the retina which is located in the back of patientâ€™s eyes. Diabetic Retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in the working-age population of the developed world and is estimated to affect over 347 million people worldwide
