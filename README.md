# Diabetic-retinopathy-detection

In this project, I developed and trained a deep neural network model utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual Blocks to accurately detect various types of Diabetic Retinopathy from retinal images. Diabetic Retinopathy is a severe complication arising from both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, often developing when blood sugar levels remain uncontrolled over an extended period. This disease results from damage to the blood vessels in the retina, which is situated at the back of the eye.

Diabetic Retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among the working-age population in developed countries, affecting over 347 million people globally. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, this project aims to enhance early detection and diagnosis, thereby improving patient outcomes and preventing severe vision loss. The integration of CNNs and Residual Blocks in the model architecture allows for capturing intricate patterns in retinal images, facilitating accurate classification and contributing to more effective screening programs for Diabetic Retinopathy.
